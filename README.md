# DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics


## Project Overview
DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics is a retail analytics project focused on the electronics industry. The aim is to conduct a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover valuable insights from Global Electronics' data and provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth


## Problem Statement
As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, the goal is to analyze data from customers, products, sales, stores, and currency exchange rates to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and drive overall business growth.

## Tools and Technologies

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python: For data cleaning, preparation, and statistical analysis (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
- SQL: For data management and querying.
- Power BI/Tableau: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.
## Business Use Cases

#### I. Marketing Strategies:
Tailor marketing campaigns and develop better products.

#### II. Inventory Management:
Optimize inventory levels.

#### III. Sales Forecasting:
Improve the accuracy of sales forecasts.

#### IV. Store Expansion:
Guide decisions on store expansions and optimizations.

#### V. International Pricing:
Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales to better set international prices.

## Approch

#### I. Data Cleaning and Preparation{}:
- Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Merge datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).
#### II. Load Data:
- Insert the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL INSERT statements to load the data.
#### III. Power BI Visualization:
- Connect SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

#### IV. Develop SQL Queries:
- Formulate and execute 10 SQL queries to extract key insights from the data.
-  These queries should address important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial initial step in data science projects. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its key characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables refers to the method of studying and exploring record sets to apprehend their predominant traits, discover patterns, locate outliers, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is normally carried out as a preliminary step before undertaking extra formal statistical analyses or modeling.

## Goals of EDA
#### I. Understand the Structure of Data:
 Get a sense of the data's shape, distribution, and key statistics.
#### II. Detect Outliers and Anomalies:
 Identify any unusual observations that might skew the analysis.
#### III. Uncover Patterns and Relationships:
Find correlations and patterns within the data.
#### IV. Test Hypotheses:
Formulate and test hypotheses based on data insights.
#### V. Prepare Data for Modeling:
Clean and preprocess the data for further analysis and modeling.

## Analysis
#### I. Customer Analysis:

- Analyze the distribution of customers based on gender, age (calculated from birthday), location (city, state, country, continent).

- Identify purchasing patterns such as average order value, frequency of purchases, and preferred products.

- Segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.

#### II. Sales Analysis:

- Analyze total sales over time, identifying trends and seasonality.

- Evaluate which products are the top performers in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.

- Assess the performance of different stores based on sales data.

- Examine how different currencies impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.

#### III. Product Analysis:

- Identify the most and least popular products based on sales data.

- Calculate profit margins for products by comparing unit cost and unit price.

- Analyze sales performance across different product categories and subcategories.

#### IV. Store Analysis:

- Evaluate store performance based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).

- Analyze sales by store location to identify high-performing regions.

## Power Bi

A Power BI dashboard is a single-page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story. Hereâ€™s an overview of the key aspects and components of a Power BI dashboard:

#### I. Tiles:

- Each visualization on a dashboard is called a tile. Tiles can be charts, graphs, maps, gauges, images, web content, and more.
- Tiles are pinned from reports and datasets, or created directly in the dashboard.

#### II. Reports:

- Dashboards are typically built from reports, which are multi-page documents containing a variety of visualizations.
- Users can pin visualizations from reports to dashboards to highlight key metrics.

#### III. Datasets:

- The data behind the visualizations comes from datasets, which can be imported or connected from various data sources.
- Datasets are used to create reports and dashboards.

#### IV. Filters and Slicers:

- Dashboards can include filters and slicers to allow users to interact with the data and view specific subsets of information.
- Slicers can be pinned to the dashboard to provide quick filtering options.

#### V. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):

- Special visualizations that show progress towards a measurable goal.
- Useful for tracking performance against targets.

## Creating a Dashboard

#### I. Connect to Data Source:
Import or connect to the data sources you need for your visualizations.

##### II. Build Reports:
 Create detailed reports with the visualizations you want to include in your dashboard.

#### III. Pin Visualizations:
Pin important visualizations from your reports to your dashboard.

#### IV. Customize Layout:
Arrange and resize tiles on your dashboard for optimal viewing.

#### V. Share and Collaborate:
Share the dashboard with others and collaborate to gain insights.

## Benefits of Power BI Dashboards:
- Concise Overview: Provides a high-level view of key metrics on a single page.

- Actionable Insights: Helps users quickly identify trends, issues, and opportunities.

- User-Friendly: Easy to create, customize, and use, making data accessible to non-technical users.

- Integrated: Seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft tools and services for a unified experience.
 
## Results:

Upon completion of the project, learners are expected to deliver a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report for Global Electronics, featuring clean and integrated datasets, in-depth insights into customer demographics, purchasing behaviors, product performance, store operations, and currency impact on sales. The report will include visually compelling visualizations and actionable recommendations tailored to enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, guide product development, and inform store expansion and operational decisions. This analysis will empower Global Electronics to increase customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and drive overall business growth.
