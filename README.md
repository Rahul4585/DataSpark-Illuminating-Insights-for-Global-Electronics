## üìù Project Overview

**DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics** is a retail analytics project focused on the electronics industry. The aim is to conduct a comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover valuable insights from Global Electronics' data and provide actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive business growth.

## üß© Problem Statement
As part of Global Electronics' data analytics team, the goal is to analyze data from **customers**, **products**, **sales**, **stores**, and **currency exchange rates** to identify key insights that will enhance marketing strategies, optimize inventory management, improve sales forecasting, and drive overall business growth.

## üõ† Tools and Technologies
Before we begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-  **Python**: For data cleaning, preparation, and statistical analysis (using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
-  **SQL**: For data management and querying.
-  **Power BI/Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.

## üíº Business Use Cases

### I.  Marketing Strategies:
Tailor marketing campaigns and develop better products.

### II.  Inventory Management:
Optimize inventory levels.

### III.  Sales Forecasting:
Improve the accuracy of sales forecasts.

### IV.  Store Expansion:
Guide decisions on store expansions and optimizations.

### V.  International Pricing:
Understand the impact of currency exchange rates on sales to better set international prices.

## üîç Approach

### I.  Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Checkeded for missing values and handle them appropriately.
- Convert data types where necessary (e.g., dates, numerical values).
- Mergeed datasets where necessary for analysis (e.g., linking sales data with product and customer data).

### II.  Load Data:
- Inserted the preprocessed data into an SQL database by creating relevant tables for each data source and using SQL `INSERT` statements to load the data.

### III. Power BI Visualization:
- Connected SQL to Power BI/Tableau, import the data, and create interactive dashboards.

### IV.  Develop SQL Queries:
- Formulated and executed **10 SQL queries** to extract key insights from the data.
- These queries addressed important business questions and support the analysis steps below.

## üìä Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial initial step in data science projects. It involves analyzing and visualizing data to understand its key characteristics, uncover patterns, and identify relationships between variables. EDA is usually conducted before undertaking more formal statistical analyses or modeling.

## üéØ Goals of EDA
### I.  Understand the Structure of Data:
 Get a sense of the data's shape, distribution, and key statistics.

### II.  Detect Outliers and Anomalies:
 Identify any unusual observations that might skew the analysis.

### III. Uncover Patterns and Relationships:
Find correlations and patterns within the data.

### IV.  Test Hypotheses:
Formulate and test hypotheses based on data insights.

### V.  Prepare Data for Modeling:
Clean and preprocess the data for further analysis and modeling.

## üî¨ Analysis

### I.  Customer Analysis:
- Analyzed the distribution of customers based on **gender**, **age**, and **location** (city, state, country, continent).
- Identified purchasing patterns such as **average order value**, **frequency of purchases**, and **preferred products**.
- Segmented customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior to identify key customer groups.

### II. Sales Analysis:
- Analyzed **total sales over time**, identifying trends and seasonality.
- Evaluated which **products are top performers** in terms of quantity sold and revenue generated.
- Assessed the performance of different **stores** based on sales data.
- Examined how different **currencies** impact sales figures, considering exchange rates.

### III. Product Analysis:
- Identified the **most and least popular products** based on sales data.
- Calculated **profit margins** by comparing unit cost and unit price.
- Analyzed **sales performance across categories and subcategories**.

### IV. Store Analysis:
- Evaluated **store performance** based on sales, size (square meters), and operational data (open date).
- Analyzed **sales by location** to identify high-performing regions.

## üìä Power BI

A **Power BI dashboard** is a single-page, often called a canvas, that uses visualizations to tell a story. Because it's limited to one page, a well-designed dashboard contains only the most important elements of that story.

### I.  Tiles:
- Each visualization on a dashboard is called a **tile**. Tiles can be charts, graphs, maps, and more.
- Tiles are pinned from reports and datasets or created directly in the dashboard.

### II.  Reports:
- Dashboards are typically built from **reports**, which are multi-page documents containing visualizations.
- Users can **pin visualizations** from reports to dashboards.

### III. Datasets:
- The data behind the visualizations comes from **datasets**, which can be imported or connected from various data sources.

### IV.  Filters and Slicers:
- Dashboards can include **filters and slicers** to allow users to interact with the data and view specific subsets of information.

### V.  KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
- Special visualizations that show progress towards a measurable goal.

## üìÇ Creating a Dashboard

### I.  Connect to Data Source:
Import or connect to the data sources you need for your visualizations.

### II.  Build Reports:
Create detailed reports with the visualizations you want to include in your dashboard.

### III. Pin Visualizations:
Pin important visualizations from your reports to your dashboard.

### IV.  Customize Layout:
Arrange and resize tiles on your dashboard for optimal viewing.

### V.  Share and Collaborate:
Share the dashboard with others and collaborate to gain insights.

## üåü Benefits of Power BI Dashboards:
- **Concise Overview**: Provides a high-level view of key metrics on a single page.
- **Actionable Insights**: Helps users quickly identify trends, issues, and opportunities.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to create, customize, and use, making data accessible to non-technical users.
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly integrates with other Microsoft tools and services.
